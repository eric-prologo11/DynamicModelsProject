\begin{sciabstract}
  As the number of wild Water Buffaloes diminishes, understanding their movement patterns and behavior is becoming increasingly imperative. As a herd animal whose movement relies heavily on its environment, the water buffalo has unique characteristics that make it interesting to model. By modeling water buffalo movement, we are able to better understand their behavior which will in turn help us with preservation efforts for both Water Buffalo and similar species as well. Previous research tracks water buffalo movement but does not use their patterns to create a model. Through building a model, we are able to capture how water buffalo move to find resources (water) when a predator is present. Our results showed that water buffalo moved more in the dry season and less in the wet season. During the wet season they chose habitats near large bodies of water, while in the dry season they settled for small bodies of water like rivers. The model also reproduced accurate herd movements when a predator is nearby.

\section*{Introduction}

Understanding how animals navigate their environment has always been a popular topic of research. Most animals must manage to collect resources while avoiding predators and protecting their offspring. Of all species, water buffalo are particularly interesting due to their dependence on the environment. Water buffaloes have different movements in the wet and dry season due to changes in the amount of water in their environment. Additionally, since water buffalo are herd animals, their movement poses a unique challenge to model. By modeling movements of water buffalo in the wet and dry season, we are not only able to better understand them as a species, but also help preserve them and other similar species. Also, with a changing climate, we are able to observe how these animals adapt to drastic changes to their environment. 

\section*{Background and Related Work}

One paper by Roug et al uses trackers to monitor movements of water buffalo. The paper measures movement during the wet and dry seasons and compares the two. The data from this paper indicates that during the wet season the buffalos moved less toward larger bodies of water and during the dry season moved more to find smaller bodies of water like rivers. Using the data from this paper, we were able to create a realistic environment for our simulation. Although we were unable to find raw movement data for water buffaloes, this paper captured their own data and reported their findings ({\it 1}). 

We haven't found any other simulations of water buffalo movement, so this may be the first one.
One other paper both measures and analyzes how water buffalo do different activities such as grazing, standing, wallowing, lying, and drinking. As described in the paper, “In this study, the tools of social network analysis are used to analyze, detect, and depict the proximity patterns in water buffaloes' activities on pasture and the effect of their age and gender on them” ({\it 2}). Although this is somewhat useful, we are more interested in the specific activity of moving and modeling it in a realistic environment. Both of these papers give important insights into how water buffalo move and what their environment looks like.

\section*{Methods}

The main method to create the buffalo herd used an approach similar to the flocking simulation as described in class. The herd has about 400 agents, and at each time step each agent's new position and velocity is calculated and updated. The agents are all attracted to each other and water sources, and are repelled by the predator in the simulation. So as an agent approaches the predator it will be repelled and as an agent approaches water it will be attracted. By using this approach we are able to simulate how the buffalo move to find resources when a predator is present.
To create water sources, we created static agents that do not move but still attract agents of the herd. The predator is controlled by the user running the program, and this way you are able to see in real time how the herd reacts to the predator's movements.
At the beginning of the simulation, the position and velocity of the herd is randomized to make the simulation more realistic and dynamic. In addition, at each time step there is an element of randomness in the position and velocity to create a more realistic simulation. This way the buffaloes move in a more unpredictable manner as opposed to moving in a straight line when no attracting or repelling agents are present.
To simulate the different seasons, we created two different environments; One for the dry season and one for the wet season. The dry season environment contained less large bodies of water and more smaller bodies like rivers. On the other hand, the wet season contained more large bodies of water and less small bodies of water. By creating a realistic difference in the environment during both seasons, we are able to capture more accurate and meaningful results from the simulation. 

To capture data from our simulation, we measured both the distance moved by buffalo by time step and cumulative distance traveled throughout the simulation. Both of these data points were captured for both the wet season and the dry season.
(add more info on how charts and graphs were created here)

\section*{Results}

Our results are depicted in the graphs below. During the wet season the buffalo had both more distance moved per time step and more cumulative distance moved than the dry season. As expected, the opposite was true for the dry season as both data points measured were less than the wet season. Also as expected, in both cases the buffalo herd moved away from the predatory and toward the water sources. Since the predator repelled the herd more than they were attracted to the water, the herd moved away from the water as the predator got closer. All of these results are in line with what we expected and also match data from our research.
(add more/better explanation for graphs include graphs here)

\section*{Conclusion}

This report shows how the movement of water buffalo changes both in the dry and wet seasons and with a predator present. Previous research from tracking data showed that water buffalo move less in the wet season and more in the dry season. Additionally, previous research showed that water buffalo move more in the dry season and find smaller bodies of water and move less in the wet season and find larger bodies of water. By creating an accurate model, we were able to show both of these insights to be true. Modeling animal habitat selection is becoming increasingly important, and especially with animals reliant on their environment. Drastic changes in the climate can affect these species directly, and understanding their movement patterns can help us with preservation efforts. Not only will this work help protect water buffaloes, but it will help other species as well.

END OF DOC BELOW ARE TIPS FOR FORMATTING

\section*{Formatting Citations}

Citations can be handled in one of three ways.  The most
straightforward (albeit labor-intensive) would be to hardwire your
citations into your \LaTeX\ source, as you would if you were using an
ordinary word processor.  Thus, your code might look something like
this:


\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
However, this record of the solar nebula may have been
partly erased by the complex history of the meteorite
parent bodies, which includes collision-induced shock,
thermal metamorphism, and aqueous alteration
({\it 1, 2, 5--7\/}).
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}


\noindent Compiled, the last two lines of the code above, of course, would give notecalls in {\it Science\/} style:

\begin{quote}
\ldots thermal metamorphism, and aqueous alteration ({\it 1, 2, 5--7\/}).
\end{quote}

Under the same logic, the author could set up his or her reference list as a simple enumeration,

\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
{\bf References and Notes}

\begin{enumerate}
\item G. Gamow, {\it The Constitution of Atomic Nuclei
and Radioactivity\/} (Oxford Univ. Press, New York, 1931).
\item W. Heisenberg and W. Pauli, {\it Zeitschr.\ f.\ 
Physik\/} {\bf 56}, 1 (1929).
\end{enumerate}
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

\noindent yielding

\begin{quote}
{\bf References and Notes}

\begin{enumerate}
\item G. Gamow, {\it The Constitution of Atomic Nuclei and
Radioactivity\/} (Oxford Univ. Press, New York, 1931).
\item W. Heisenberg and W. Pauli, {\it Zeitschr.\ f.\ Physik} {\bf 56},
1 (1929).
\end{enumerate}
\end{quote}


That's not a solution that's likely to appeal to everyone, however ---
especially not to users of B{\small{IB}}\TeX\ \cite{inclme}.  If you
are a B{\small{IB}}\TeX\ user, we suggest that you use the
\texttt{Science.bst} bibliography style file and the
\texttt{scicite.sty} package, both of which are downloadable from our author help site.
{\bf While you can use B{\small{IB}}\TeX\ to generate the reference list, please don't submit 
your .bib and .bbl files; instead, paste the generated .bbl file into the .tex file, creating
 \texttt{\{thebibliography\}} environment.}
 You can also
generate your reference lists directly by using 
\texttt{\{thebibliography\}} at the end of your source document; here
again, you may find the \texttt{scicite.sty} file useful.

Whatever you use, be
very careful about how you set up your in-text reference calls and
notecalls.  In particular, observe the following requirements:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Please follow the style for references outlined at our author
  help site and embodied in recent issues of {\it Science}.  Each
  citation number should refer to a single reference; please do not
  concatenate several references under a single number.
\item The reference numbering  continues from the 
main text to the Supplementary Materials (e.g. this main 
text has references 1-3; the numbering of references in the 
Supplementary Materials should start with 4). 
\item Please cite your references and notes in text {\it only\/} using
  the standard \LaTeX\ \verb+\cite+ command, not another command
  driven by outside macros.
\item Please separate multiple citations within a single \verb+\cite+
  command using commas only; there should be {\it no space\/}
  between reference keynames.  That is, if you are citing two
  papers whose bibliography keys are \texttt{keyname1} and
  \texttt{keyname2}, the in-text cite should read
  \verb+\cite{keyname1,keyname2}+, {\it not\/}
  \verb+\cite{keyname1, keyname2}+.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent Failure to follow these guidelines could lead
to the omission of the references in an accepted paper when the source
file is translated to Word via HTML.



\section*{Handling Math, Tables, and Figures}

Following are a few things to keep in mind in coding equations,
tables, and figures for submission to {\it Science}.

\paragraph*{In-line math.}  The utility that we use for converting
from \LaTeX\ to HTML handles in-line math relatively well.  It is best
to avoid using built-up fractions in in-line equations, and going for
the more boring ``slash'' presentation whenever possible --- that is,
for \verb+$a/b$+ (which comes out as $a/b$) rather than
\verb+$\frac{a}{b}$+ (which compiles as $\frac{a}{b}$).  
 Please do not code arrays or matrices as
in-line math; display them instead.  And please keep your coding as
\TeX-y as possible --- avoid using specialized math macro packages
like \texttt{amstex.sty}.

\paragraph*{Tables.}  The HTML converter that we use seems to handle
reasonably well simple tables generated using the \LaTeX\
\texttt{\{tabular\}} environment.  For very complicated tables, you
may want to consider generating them in a word processing program and
including them as a separate file.

\paragraph*{Figures.}  Figure callouts within the text should not be
in the form of \LaTeX\ references, but should simply be typed in ---
that is, \verb+(Fig. 1)+ rather than \verb+\ref{fig1}+.  For the
figures themselves, treatment can differ depending on whether the
manuscript is an initial submission or a final revision for acceptance
and publication.  For an initial submission and review copy, you can
use the \LaTeX\ \verb+{figure}+ environment and the
\verb+\includegraphics+ command to include your PostScript figures at
the end of the compiled file.  For the final revision,
however, the \verb+{figure}+ environment should {\it not\/} be used;
instead, the figure captions themselves should be typed in as regular
text at the end of the source file (an example is included here), and
the figures should be uploaded separately according to the Art
Department's instructions.








\section*{What to Send In}

What you should send to {\it Science\/} will depend on the stage your manuscript is in:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Important:} If you're sending in the initial submission of
  your manuscript (that is, the copy for evaluation and peer review),
  please send in {\it only\/} a PDF version of the
  compiled file (including figures).  Please do not send in the \TeX\ 
  source, \texttt{.sty}, \texttt{.bbl}, or other associated files with
  your initial submission.  (For more information, please see the
  instructions at our Web submission site.)
\item When the time comes for you to send in your revised final
  manuscript (i.e., after peer review), we require that you include
   source files and generated files in your upload. {\bf The .tex file should include
the reference list as an itemized list (see "Formatting citations"  for the various options). The bibliography should not be in a separate file.}  
  Thus, if the
  name of your main source document is \texttt{ltxfile.tex}, you
  need to include:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{ltxfile.tex}.
\item \texttt{ltxfile.aux}, the auxilliary file generated by the
  compilation.
\item A PDF file generated from
  \texttt{ltxfile.tex}.

\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
